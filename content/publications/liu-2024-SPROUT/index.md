abstract: "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has revolutionized the efficiency of creating programming tutorials. LLMs can be instructed with text prompts to generate comprehensive text descriptions for code snippets provided by users. However, the lack of transparency in the end-to-end generation process has hindered the understanding of model behavior and limited user control over the generated results. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach that breaks down the programming tutorial creation task into actionable steps. By employing the tree-of-thought method, LLMs engage in an exploratory process to generate diverse and faithful programming tutorials. We then present SPROUT, an authoring tool equipped with a series of interactive visualizations that empower users to have greater control and understanding of the programming tutorial creation process. A formal user study demonstrated the effectiveness of SPROUT, showing that our tool assists users to actively participate in the programming tutorial creation process, leading to more reliable and customizable results. By providing users with greater control and understanding, SPROUT enhances the user experience and improves the overall quality of programming tutorial.A free copy of this paper and all supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/uez2t/."
