abstract: "Recently, Large Language Model based Autonomous System (LLMAS) has gained great popularity for its potential to simulate complicated behaviors of human societies. One of its main challenges is to present and analyze the dynamic events evolution of LLMAS. In this work, we present a visualization approach to explore the detailed statuses and agents' behavior within LLMAS. Our approach outlines a general pipeline that organizes raw execution events from LLMAS into a structured behavior model. We leverage a behavior summarization algorithm to create a hierarchical summary of these behaviors, arranged according to their sequence over time. Additionally, we design a cause trace method to mine the causal relationship between agent behaviors. We then develop AgentLens , a visual analysis system that leverages a hierarchical temporal visualization for illustrating the evolution of LLMAS, and supports users to interactively investigate details and causes of agents' behaviors. Two usage scenarios and a user study demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our AgentLens."
