abstract: "The development of digitized humanity information provides a new perspective on data-oriented studies of history. Many previous studies have ignored uncertainty in the exploration of historical figures and events, which has limited the capability of researchers to capture complex processes associated with historical phenomena. We propose a visual reasoning system to support visual reasoning of uncertainty associated with spatio-temporal events of historical figures based on data from the China Biographical Database Project. We build a knowledge graph of entities extracted from a historical database to capture uncertainty generated by missing data and error. The proposed system uses an overview of chronology, a map view, and an interpersonal relation matrix to describe and analyse heterogeneous information of events. The system also includes uncertainty visualization to identify uncertain events with missing or imprecise spatio-temporal information. Results from case studies and expert evaluations suggest that the visual reasoning system is able to quantify and reduce uncertainty generated by the data."
